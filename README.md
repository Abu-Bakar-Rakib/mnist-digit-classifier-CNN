# mnist-digit-classifier-CNN
This project demonstrates how to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving high accuracy and visualizing predictions. It includes steps from data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the trained model.
